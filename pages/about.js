        <p>My Rocket League bots are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which is facilitated through stable-baselines. This framework is incredibly helpful in obtaining PPO for my bots. Additionally, I utilize an environment called RLGym to train my Rocket League bots, as it proves to be a useful tool for this purpose.</p>
